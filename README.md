![Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Completed-brightgreen)  

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is part of an **end-of-course database project**.  
The goal was to design and implement a **Hospital Management System (HMS)** that can efficiently handle hospital operations such as **patients, doctors, appointments, medical records, staff, and billing**.  
To extend functionality, an **interactive Power BI dashboard** was also created to provide insights into hospital performance and decision-making.  

---

## 🎯 Business Task  
Develop a relational database and reporting solution to:  
1. Model hospital operations using an **Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**.  
2. Normalize data up to **3NF** and implement it in **SQL**.  
3. Execute queries to manage and analyze patient and hospital records.  
4. Build a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize patient statistics, appointments, and revenue trends.  

---

## 🗂 Database Design  
- **Entities:** Patients, Doctors, Appointments, Medical Records, Staff, Billing  
- **Normalization:** All tables were normalized to **Third Normal Form (3NF)** to reduce redundancy.  
- **Schema & ERD:** Designed using MySQL Workbench / draw.io.

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies  
- **SQL (MySQL):** Schema creation, data insertion, and queries  
- **Power BI:** Interactive dashboards and reports  
- **Modeling Tools:** MySQL Workbench / draw.io for ERD  
- **Excel:** Used for initial data review and export  

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard  
The Power BI dashboard highlights:  
- **Patient demographics** (age and gender distributions)  
- **Appointments overview** (by doctor, department, and weekdays)  
- **Revenue analysis** (billing by department, payment status)  
- **Doctor workload** (number of patients per doctor)
